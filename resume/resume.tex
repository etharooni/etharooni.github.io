\descript{| Firmware/EE/Systems Consultant}
\location{Dec. 2023 - Present | North Hollywood, CA}
\begin{tightitemize}
%\item 
%Hired as a consultant to spearhead upgrading traditional video production studio equipment to software control.

\item
Responsible for systems design, power-electronics design, high reliability real-time firmware, UI firmware, and systems integration for an 8000 pound hydraulic/electric studio video-production crane base to run IMU-based hydraulic post-stabilization, servo drive for repeated movements, and wireless console for user control.

\item 
Designed PCBAs, created firmware/bootloader suite, and produced a small production run of a camera-head "Mini-Console" with touch screen interface created using ST TouchGFX.  Created a series of user-interface devices and associated electronics and firmware to interface with the Mini-Console.

\item Coordinated a small team of mechanical engineers for electro-mechanical upgrades to existing bases.
