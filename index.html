				<div class="groupCaption">I'm a big fan of making stuff.  I love the process of coming up with an idea, and breaking it down into all the bits that make it into reality.  Because I get so much intrinsic enjoyment from making things, most of the time I neglect the sharing-with-the-world aspect of building things, which I realize is a shame!  I've decided to start making a concious effort to log the projects through the years that I'm proud of - so here it is: one short paragraph and about a weird mix of steel artwork, embedded systems, software, and robots - in no meaningful order.</div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="hammerkartsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Hammerkart</span><br>The Hammerkart is a 640lb, nearly 200hp go kart.  The engine was liberated from a junkyard and once lived in a front-wheel drive Infiniti G20.  This SR20 powered deathsled is unencumbered by bourgeois luxuries like suspension or floor panels, and never fails to make you grin ear to ear.  <br>In 2018 I upgraded the electronic fuel injection with fully custom hardware and software adapted from the Megasquirt and Speeduino projects - it's based off of an STM32F4 processor and controls injectors, spark timing, idle, and listens to a variety of sensors to deliver the optimal performance at any RPM/load/temperature/elevation.</span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="stoolsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Stool Sample</span><br>The Stool Sample is my attempt at a futuristic electric vehicle, powered by two 6KW brushless motors and Freefly Arc200 motor drives.  It features a vinyl bar stool and horizontal bus steering wheel - which makes for an overwhelming driving experience as butt-to-seat friction is minimized.  The stool sample features a custom gyro-stabilized <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3My0LxTqVE">wheelie mode</a> and has full control over differential steering using the steering wheel, and wheelie angle using the gas pedal.  If you have a passenger, it also includes a trailer hitch for pulling around a <a href="barstooltrailer.jpg">second train car. </a></span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="freeflysmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Products I've helped launch at <a href="https://freeflysystems.com/">Freefly</a></span><br>For about three years now, I've been a robotics engineer with a small team in Woodinville, WA who have been involved with creating innovative products in the world of cinematic camera movement.  I've gotten to work on too many projects to list on this page, but here are several: <br>I've been very heavily involved in the design, and software + electrical implementation of several gimbals:<a href="https://gomovi.com/">Movi Cinema Robot</a>, a mobile film-making robot, and <a href="https://vimeo.com/285574719/c14795272c">M≈çVI Carbon</a>, the world's smallest cinema grade five-axis gimbal.<br><a href="https://freeflysystems.com/astro">Freefly Astro</a>, an incredibly ambitious project for a small team, is a drone - with associated gimbal, smart battery, and complete software package with fleet management/mapping/surveying - and has been my baby for the past ~year of development.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="3phsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Field-Oriented Brushless Servo Controller</span><br>Started as a computer science capstone project for my senior year at UPS, this controller drives off-the-shelf sensored hobby brushless motors as industrial servos to regulate torque, RPM, and position with stepper motor style input.  A new version is currently being designed that can drive three servos with a single on-board STM32F4 processor. </span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><iframe width="400" height="275" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vfDIjQdnwts?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Couch Trailer</span><br>I've had a history of working on an expanding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zL3IDL9snE">fleet</a> of motorized furniture.  When my neighbor asked if I wanted to get rid of his couch, I was feeling nostalgic.  I said yes; I added wheels, a trailer tongue, an e-brake for sick skids, and nearly got arrested for taking it for a spin around Green Lake.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="nitrogengensmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Nitrogen Generator</span><br>Built and programmed for the UPS chem department to replace continuous replacement of nitrogen dewars to drive analytical equipment.  This system uses computer controlled pressure-swing-absorption to filter the oxygen from compressed air and is currently delivering 24/7 nitrogen to multiple labs around campus.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="stringwindersmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">String Winder</span><br>Built for a UPS physics faculty member for research on non-uniform guitar strings.  This computer-controlled guitar string lathe winds guitar strings with a user-specified mass density.  It can also calculate the pitch of the wound guitar string with a record player needle, and accurately measures the real mass-density.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="cranesmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Sketchy-ass camera car</span><br>When working at Freefly Systems, I got inspired by incredible footage and never-before-seen camera motion by Freefly customers from purpose-built camera cars.  Sadly, to purchase these camera cars requires nearly four orders of magnitude bigger budget than I had, so I turned my Subaru into a camera car instead!<br>I've developed accessories for it as well - like a vibration-isolating arm that sticks on the end of the crane or into the front/rear trailer hitches.<br>Footage I shot with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Mumukuba/">Mumukuba Productions</a> from this crane was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cinematogr/videos/1616195538425991">internet famous</a> for a bit!</span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="cncsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">CNC Plasma Cutter</span><br>This custom CNC plasma cutter uses an Everlast torch and is powered by LinuxCNC.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="cardspoofersmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Card Spoofer</span><br>Students around UPS want to let fellow students into their dorm building for group projects or to hang out in a lounge.  Currently, a student has to physically give a peer their student ID card to let anyone in.  Now, you can feel like you're in Mission-Impossible and use the cardspoofer to emulate the electromagnetic strip by only entering their student ID number.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="fishsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Sculpture: Fish</span><br>I have a series of steel scrap sculptures built over the course of the last few years.  This one is one of my favorites, and currently lives in a padio in Massachusetts.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="dinosmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Sculpture: Dino</span><br>The dino was built to clear out my ever increasing scrap pile in my garage.  If you live in Tacoma, maybe you've seen it shoot fire at pedestrians from its onboard propane tank.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="walkingsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Theo Jansen Walking Machine</span><br>This 12-legged walking machine was built after my senior year in high school and is powered by a 6hp cement mixer engine.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="potterywheelsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Pottery Wheel</span><br>At the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown, I decided I wanted to get into pottery.  First step, make a pottery wheel.  This pottery wheel is made from an electric bike motor and scrap steel from my garage.  I decided to make life hard on myself by making it all from scratch - including motor control electronics and software.  The foot pedal was especially fun to make - the structure is steel but all internals are 3D printed mechanisms.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="trailersmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Drop Trailer</span><br>Tilt trailers are a)difficult to load awkward loads, b)absurdly heavy, and c)absurdly expensive.  This was designed and built out of necessity to carry heavy awkward loads out of my house.  It uses bottle jacks to fully drop the trailer to the ground, and a winch to pull loads onto the bed.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="teslaeggsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Tesla Egg</span><br>The Tesla egg was one of Nikola Tesla's original demonstrations of A/C electricity.  This was built as a display for the UPS science building.  The solid aluminum egg spins on end when electric currents are induced throughout it.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="intervalometersmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Intervalometer</span><br>One of my earliest embedded systems projects: powered by an Atmel AVR, this camera controller is designed to trigger Canon DSLRs through a 2.5mm stereo cable, or Nikon DSLRs with an infrared remote.  It is perfect for long-exposure or time-lapse photography.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="battlebotsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Twist-O-Crunch</span><br>Way back in the day, in my sophomore year in high school, a friend and I raised money on Kickstarter to build this 120lb battlebot for the 2011 Robogames.</span></span></div>
