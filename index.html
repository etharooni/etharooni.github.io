				<div class="picture"><img src="profilesmall.png"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">About me</span><br>Hi!  My name is Ethan Russell.  I'm a software engineer specializing in robotics and firmware/embedded systems.  I love learning new skills, so as a result, I try to work on stuff that involves a breadth of disciplines because limiting myself to one tiny aspect of a project can be boring.<br><br>When I'm not working on projects like the ones on this site, I like to climb rocks and generally play in the beautiful Cascades near my home in Seattle, WA.</span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="websitelogosmall.png"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">About this website</span><br>I'm a big fan of making stuff.  I love the process of coming up with an idea, and breaking it down into all the bits that make it into reality.  Because I get so much intrinsic enjoyment from making things, most of the time I neglect the sharing-with-the-world aspect of building things, which I realize is a shame!  I've decided to start making a conscious effort to log the projects through the years that I'm proud of - so here it is: one short paragraph and a thumbnail of a weird mix of steel artwork, embedded systems, software, and robots - in no meaningful order.<br><br>While unfinished, I want to turn this website into a sort of portfolio of professional and personal projects that I'm proud of.  Mostly though, it's an excuse to play with making HTML5 canvas visualizions (it's an incredibly addicting time-suck).<br>The documentation of the projects on this site is not always the priority, so if you'd like to learn more about any of them, definitey email me!</span></div>

				<div class="groupCaption">I've fallen in love with fabricating stuff out of metal ever since I happened across a garage sale welder as a bright-eyed teenager.  Many of my fabrication projects involve aspects of other disciplines - electronics, software, etc. - but I figured this category makes as much sense as any.</div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="hammerkartsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Hammerkart</span><span class="dateText">2014</span><br><br>The Hammerkart is a 640lb, nearly 200hp go kart.  The engine was liberated from a junkyard and once lived in a front-wheel drive Infiniti G20.  This SR20 powered deathsled is unencumbered by bourgeois luxuries like suspension or floor panels, and never fails to make you grin ear to ear.  <br>In 2018 I upgraded the electronic fuel injection with fully custom hardware and software adapted from the Megasquirt and Speeduino projects - it's based off of an STM32F4 processor and controls injectors, spark timing, idle, and listens to a variety of sensors to deliver the optimal performance at any RPM/load/temperature/elevation.</span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="stoolsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Stool Sample</span><span class="dateText">2018</span><br><br>The Stool Sample is my attempt at a futuristic electric vehicle, powered by two 6KW brushless motors and Freefly Arc200 motor drives.  It features a vinyl bar stool and horizontal bus steering wheel - which makes for an overwhelming driving experience as butt-to-seat friction is minimized.  The stool sample features a custom gyro-stabilized <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3My0LxTqVE">wheelie mode</a> and has full control over differential steering using the steering wheel, and wheelie angle using the gas pedal.  If you have a passenger, it also includes a trailer hitch for pulling around a <a href="barstooltrailer.jpg">second train car. </a></span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="computersmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Steel "Laptop" Computer</span><span class="dateText">2021</span><br><br>When I realized my computer was starting to be a little outdated, slow, and couldn't hold a charge, I debated long and hard about whether to buy a new laptop or a desktop.  Desktop computers are more easily upgradable and much more powerful for the cost but cannot be transported.  This decision was too hard so I tried to find a solution with no compromises - introduce my "TOP-LAP".  This computer is made from laser cut steel with a full embedded 24" fold-up monitor.  It uses a Freefly SL-8 drone battery for power, and a custom CAN communication board that gives the computer SOC/voltage/current telemetry and charger + battery control.  It has gas struts to open the screen, a full car stereo system for audio.  In addition to looking badass, the computer specs are badass to match.  It uses a top-of-the-line AMD Ryzen processor, 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of fast onboard solid state drives.  Best of all, it's still entirely portable and can run on battery power for 4+ hours.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="wheeliebikesmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Wheelie Bike</span><span class="dateText">2023</span><br><br>I've built many motorized bikes back in my day, but this is the one that's my daily driver around town.  There is no better feeling than passing cars doing a computer controlled wheelie on childrens bicycle up the Seattle Madison Park hill to get groceries every week.  It started its life as a Magna Carolina Cruisin bicycle, and I welded on brackets to support a 1kW hub motor (overclocked to nearly 8kW peak).  I added a fully custom motor drive (recently upgraded from the Freefly Arc200 for more powah!) with a built in gyro and accelerometer for stabilized wheelies.  It has a custom 75V battery pack made with 36 21700 batteries and a custom OLED dashboard on the handlebars that took about 10x more engineering time than the whole rest of the bike. </span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="mtbsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">DIY Mountain Bike</span><span class="dateText">2025</span><br><br>I've been interested in getting into mountain biking for years, but with a price tag worth over all of my cars combined, my only option was to make one for myself.  As someone who never mountain-biked at the beginning of the project, I totally lucked out on the geometry I pulled out of my ass.  It has 190mm of rear travel, and isn't the lightest thing, but it flies on the uphill as well as the downhill.  This build was the most cowboy version of a moutain bike build as could be (no frame jigs, made almost entirely with rusty scrap metal), but it's super capable and I love it.</span></span></div>

When my neighbor asked if I wanted to get rid of his couch, I was feeling nostalgic.  I said yes; I added wheels, a trailer tongue, an e-brake for sick skids, and nearly got arrested for taking it for a spin around Green Lake.</span></span></div>
				<div class="picture"><img src="cranesmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Sketchy-ass camera car</span><span class="dateText">2017</span><br><br>When working at Freefly Systems, I got inspired by incredible footage and never-before-seen camera motion by Freefly customers from purpose-built camera cars.  Sadly, to purchase these camera cars requires nearly four orders of magnitude bigger budget than I had, so I turned my Subaru into a camera car instead!<br>I've developed accessories for it as well - like a vibration-isolating arm that sticks on the end of the crane or into the front/rear trailer hitches.<br>Footage I shot with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Mumukuba/">Mumukuba Productions</a> from this crane was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cinematogr/videos/1616195538425991">internet famous</a> for a bit!</span></div>

				<div class="picture"><img src="potterywheelsmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Pottery Wheel</span><span class="dateText">2020</span><br><br>At the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown, I decided I wanted to get into pottery.  First step: make a pottery wheel.  This pottery wheel is made from an electric bike motor and scrap steel from my garage.  I decided to make life hard on myself by making it all from scratch - including motor control electronics and software.  The foot pedal was especially fun to make - the structure is steel but all internals are 3D printed mechanisms.</span></span></div>

				<div class="picture"><img src="trailersmall.jpg"><span class="caption"><span class="captionTitle">Drop Trailer</span><span class="dateText">2016</span><br><br>Tilt trailers are a)difficult to load awkward loads, b)absurdly heavy, and c)absurdly expensive.  This was designed and built out of necessity to carry heavy awkward loads out of my house.  It uses bottle jacks to fully drop the trailer to the ground, and a winch to pull loads onto the bed.</span></span></div>
